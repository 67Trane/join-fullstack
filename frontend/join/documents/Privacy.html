      <h1>INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h1>

      <p>(1) In the following, we inform you about the collection of personal data when using our website. Personal data refers to any data that can be related to you personally, e.g., name, address, email addresses, user behavior.</p>
  
      <p>(2) The data controller in accordance with Art. 4 para. 7 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Team Join 318.</p>
  
      <p>(3) When you contact us by email, phone, fax, or via a contact form, the data you provide (your email address, your name, and your phone number if applicable) will be stored by us in order to answer your questions. The data arising in this context will be deleted once the storage is no longer necessary, or processing will be restricted if statutory retention obligations exist.</p>
  
      <p>(4) If we rely on commissioned service providers for certain functions of our offer or intend to use your data for promotional purposes, we will inform you in detail about the respective processes below. We will also specify the established criteria for the storage period.</p>
  
      <h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
  
      <p>(1) You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Right to access,</li>
          <li>Right to rectification or erasure,</li>
          <li>Right to restrict processing,</li>
          <li>Right to object to processing,</li>
          <li>Right to data portability.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>(2) You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data.</p>
  
      <h2>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN VISITING OUR WEBSITE</h2>
  
      <p>(1) If you use the website for informational purposes only, i.e., if you do not send us any other information, we only collect the personal data your browser transmits to our server. If you want to view our website, we collect the following data, which is technically necessary for us to display our website to you and to ensure stability and security (the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR):</p>
  
      <ul>
          <li>IP address,</li>
          <li>Date and time of the request,</li>
          <li>Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT),</li>
          <li>Content of the request (specific page),</li>
          <li>Access status/HTTP status code,</li>
          <li>Amount of data transferred,</li>
          <li>Website from which the request originates,</li>
          <li>Browser,</li>
          <li>Operating system and its interface,</li>
          <li>Language and version of the browser software.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>(2) In addition to the aforementioned data, cookies may be stored on your computer when you use our website—either now or in the future. Cookies are small text files stored on your hard drive and assigned to the browser you use, through which the entity that sets the cookie (in this case, us) receives certain information. Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to your computer. They serve to make the internet offer more user-friendly and effective overall (the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR). You can generally delete or block cookies in your browser settings at any time. We may also use technologies known as Local Storage or Session Storage, which allow data to be stored locally in your browser’s cache. This data remains even after closing the browser window or shutting down the program unless you manually clear the cache. Local storage helps save your preferences while using our website. Session Storage is similar but only retains data for the browser session. No third parties can access the data stored in Local or Session Storage. This data will not be shared with third parties or used for advertising purposes. These technologies are used, for instance, to present our content in an appealing graphic format (e.g., pop-up windows) and personalize our offering for easier navigation.</p>
  
      <p>(3) We primarily use these techniques to improve the user experience and functionality of our websites. We do so based on our legitimate interest in providing a fully functional, attractive offering, per Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Where consent is required for the use of cookies, we will ask for your consent at the appropriate place. If you do not wish these techniques to be used, you can disable them in your browser settings.</p>
  
      <h2>ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS AND OFFERS ON OUR WEBSITE</h2>
  
      <p>(1) In addition to the purely informational use of our website, we may offer various services that you can use if you are interested. For this, you will typically need to provide additional personal data, which we will use to provide the respective service, and the principles for data processing outlined above will apply.</p>
  
      <p>(2) We sometimes use external service providers to process your data. These providers are carefully selected, commissioned by us, bound by our instructions, and regularly monitored.</p>
  
      <p>(3) We may also share your personal data with third parties when we offer promotions, contests, or similar services in collaboration with partners. You will receive detailed information on this when you provide your personal data or below in the description of the offer.</p>
  
      <h2>OBJECTION OR WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT TO DATA PROCESSING</h2>
  
      <p>(1) If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw it at any time. Such a withdrawal will affect the lawfulness of processing your personal data after you have expressed it to us.</p>
  
      <p>(2) If we base the processing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you can object to the processing. This is the case if the processing is not necessary for fulfilling a contract with you, which we will outline in the respective function descriptions. If you object, please explain why we should not process your personal data as we have. In the case of your justified objection, we will review the situation and either stop or adjust the data processing or explain our compelling legitimate grounds for continuing it.</p>
  
      <p>(3) You can, of course, object to the processing of your personal data for advertising and data analysis purposes at any time. You can inform us of your objection to advertising through Team Join 318.</p>
  
      <h2>DURATION OF STORAGE OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
  
      <p>We store personal data according to statutory retention periods (e.g., commercial and tax law retention periods). Afterward, the respective data will be deleted, provided it is no longer required for contract fulfillment and/or there is no legitimate interest in continued storage.</p>
  
      <h2>GOOGLE WEB FONTS</h2>
  
      <p>(1) This site uses web fonts provided by Google for uniform font representation (the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR). The Google Fonts are loaded directly from a Google server. To enable this technically, your browser sends a request to Google, transmitting additional information, including your browser name, version, the webpage requesting the font, your operating system, IP address, and browser language settings. If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font from your computer will be used. More information on Google Web Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts FAQ</a> and in <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  
      <h2>FIREBASE REALTIME DATABASE</h2>
  
      <p>(1) This website uses Firebase Realtime Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database provided by Google LLC. Firebase is used to store and synchronize data in real-time across all connected clients. The data is transmitted to and stored by Google. Firebase may collect data such as IP addresses, device information, and the activities performed in real-time within the application.</p>
  
      <p>(2) The legal basis for using Firebase Realtime Database is our legitimate interest in providing a reliable, real-time data management solution, as well as your consent if applicable (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).</p>
  
      <p>(3) More information on Firebase’s data processing can be found in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</p>
