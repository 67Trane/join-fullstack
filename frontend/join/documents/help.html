      <h3>What is <span class="font-color-blue">Join</span>?</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="font-color-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
        the Developer Akademie. <br>
        <br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is
        a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
        maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="font-color-blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban
        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
        interface. <br>
        <br>
        It is important to note that <span class="font-color-blue">Join</span> is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
